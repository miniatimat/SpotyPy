Python Project: SpotyPy

SpotiPy is a graph simulation of Spotify in which we have songs, which are linked together 
when a user has them added to the same playlist. 

To start the app:
1: Open a Terminal,
2: Go to the SpotyPy folder
3: Input the following into the terminal to start with our current database of songs (152,666 entries)
    "py recomendify.py spotify-mini.tsv"
    And wait for the program to initialize
4: Once the program has initialized, you can choose the following commands:

 -'camino'
 -'mas_importantes'
 -'recomendacion'
 -'ciclo'
 -'rango'
 -'clustering'
